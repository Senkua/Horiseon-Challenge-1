# HoriseonChallenge

## Description

- I created this project to add fixes and accessibility to the website Horiseon.
- The fixes applied make all the links work / fix unproperly classed css as well as unproperly commented font, in addition, a hover color when hovering over the three header options was added as well.
- I learnt about some basic debugging and how to spot multiple errors involving font comments and id errors.
